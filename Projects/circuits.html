            An <strong>application</strong> was developed in <strong>C#</strong> as a Year 1 project that uses logical principles to build and simulate circuits. The tool allows users to design circuits based on various logical operations, providing a hands-on approach to understanding circuit construction and behavior. The project focused on the following key aspects:
          </p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Circuit Design:</strong> Users can design circuits based on logical operations, helping them visualize and understand circuit behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Logic Gates Implementation:</strong> Focused on implementing core concepts of logic gates and digital circuit design.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Simulated the behavior of circuits, providing a practical way to experiment with logic and digital principles.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            This project provided valuable experience in the following areas:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>C# Programming:</strong> Gained hands-on experience in C# programming to implement the tool's functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Applied problem-solving skills to design and simulate digital circuits.</li>
            <li><strong>Software Development:</strong> Gained experience in software development through the creation of a simulation tool for learning logic and circuits.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Overall, this project helped reinforce understanding of fundamental computing principles and provided a solid foundation for future software development projects.
